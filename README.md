# PolishNationalParks

My very first android app ever created at Study Jam 2016 Android (GDG Warsaw).

It gives you basic functionality of reading information about all 23 Polish National Parks
and by clicking on the link below the picture you can go directly to the Park's website
for more information. After pressing appropriate butten it shows you a location of the Park
on the map.
